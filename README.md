=========

This project was made for a class out at [Washington University](wustl.edu)
for CSE 550A using ROS and C++

Setup
-----
Make sure you have the latest cturtle install of ROS. This also means
it is debian based only. ROS has not been fully setup for other systems.
For more information on ROS, visit: <http://ros.org />

To Do
-----
This project still very much needs revisted and refactored.

* Refactor
* Re-run to ensure it works on a Pioneer with proper color threshholds
* Finish readme for thorough setup instructions.
