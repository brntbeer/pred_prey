     This package is intended to be used on either an erratic or pioneer base. The objective of this
     lab is to demonstrate a reactive control architecture of a robot. During the exercise, the robot
     is to wonder around randomly and avoid predators. Once its hunger level reaches a certain point
     the robot will begin looking for food, all the while keeping a watchful eye for predators. This 
     feeding behavior is to be repeated 3 times, at which time the demonstration will end.
